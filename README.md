# Odyssey

## Synopsis and Motivation

* The main purpose of this application is to generate enthusiasm and awareness about the LSST project amongst the users.

## Description

* The application lets users create an account so they can “catch” transients on the virtual sky plotted on the device using a sky map. By zooming in on a cluster of stars on the sky map, the user can find and read about that particular transient at that point. Furthermore, the “caught” transients will be saved on the user’s account for future research and perusal. The areas with the most transients would be labelled as “hotspots” that users can potentially “teleport to” so as to collect more transients and increase their rewards.

## Environment

* Android 5.0+

## Languages

* Java (API 20)
* SQL
* Python
* JSON
